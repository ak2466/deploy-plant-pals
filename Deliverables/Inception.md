Group Members:

## 1) Introduction:
Welcome to Plant Pals, a hub for all things green!

Plant Pals is built to act as a resource for plant enthusiasts looking for information, a community, and a platform that ties both together. Hosting a searchable database for plants, Plant Pals aims to make it easier for plant lovers to get the information they need about how to care for their green friends. From general care to more specific details, Plant Pals aims to provide all the information a user could ask for. Plant Pals also hosts a community hub for enthusiasts to share their love of plants or to ask questions. Plant Pals also offers a specialized Plant Portfolio to the user on their profile page. Along with the private, digital display, Plant Pals offers the option for the user to fill out a table to keep track of their plant's weekly watering times. This is done to give the user an included space to keep track of their plants, look up information about plants, and talk to other like-minded individuals.

Describe in one paragraph what your project is about. Make it clear what problem your software is solving and the context of the solution.
- Grading criteria (5 points): Your paragraph should be well written in formal language and must contain all the required information. Be clear, concise, and check for typos and grammar errors. 

## 2) Initial value proposition and customer segments: 
Report the initial guesses for the (i) value proposition and (ii) customer segment. The value proposition should make clear what your product is, the target customer, the value you provide, and why your product is unique. See examples on the lecture slides.
- Grading criteria (5 points): The value proposition should make clear the value from the point of view of the customer. It should not be a slogan or a description of functionality.

The customer segment should not be too broad or too specific.
