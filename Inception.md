# Introduction: 
Describe in one paragraph what your project is about. Make it clear what problem your software is solving and the context of the solution.
- Grading criteria (5 points): Your paragraph should be well written in formal language and must contain all the required information. Be clear, concise, and check for typos and grammar errors. 

# Initial value proposition and customer segments: 
Report the initial guesses for the (i) value proposition and (ii) customer segment. The value proposition should make clear what your product is, the target customer, the value you provide, and why your product is unique. See examples on the lecture slides.
- Grading criteria (5 points): The value proposition should make clear the value from the point of view of the customer. It should not be a slogan or a description of functionality. The value proposition and consumer segment should be coherent with the text in the previous section---in particular, the value should address the problem reported above (problem-solution fit). The customer segment should not be too broad or too specific. 

# Interviews summary: 
Present the results of each interview (the minimum number of interviews is 1.5 * the number of participants in the group). 
For each interview, report:

## Interviewee Name
### When they were interviewed
### Customer segment
### Key insights from the interview
### Representative quotes
### Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Donâ€™t care (how the interviewee sees the solution)
- Grading criteria (15 points): You should have at least the required number of interviews. For each interview, you should report the required information. The insight should be grounded on the interview and illustrated by the representative quotes. 

# Final value proposition and consumer segments: 
report the refined versions of these elements (the ones that you reached after the interviews). 
- Grading criteria (5 points): There must be a connection between the key insights of the interviews and the refinement of the value proposition and customer segments previously presented. See also criteria for Section 2 of this document.
